# The `.lycheeignore` file is only used for excluding URLs, not paths. Use the `exclude_path` key in the `lychee.toml` file. ref: https://github.com/lycheeverse/lycheeverse.github.io/blob/master/recipes/excluding-paths.md
# The file allows you to list multiple regular expressions for exclusion (one pattern per line).
# These links are ignored by lychee link checker: https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee
